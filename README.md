## *E. coli* experiments

Code to repeat our experiments on *E. coli* for our manuscript "Model-X knockoffs suggest fundamental limits on regulatory network identification". For more info, see the [central project repo](https://github.com/ekernf01/knockoffs_paper). Anyone should be able to repeat our experiments by using the same environment we used on AWS (Ubuntu 18.04); see `run_on_aws.sh` for details.
